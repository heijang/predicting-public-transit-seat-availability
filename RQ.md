### RQ1 – Performance & Horizons
How do external factors (e.g., weather, events, holidays) improve seat availability prediction accuracy across different prediction horizons (30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, next day), and what does this imply for short-term operations versus passenger trip planning?

### RQ2 – Explainability with SHAP
How do external factors shape SHAP-based explanations of seat availability predictions in special scenarios such as concert nights, storm days, and holiday weekends?

### RQ3 – Decision Support
In what ways can improved and explainable seat availability predictions be used to support (a) passenger decision-making (“Should I take this train or the next one?”) and (b) operational planning for load balancing and crowd management in simulated use cases?
